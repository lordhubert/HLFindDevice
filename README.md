# FindDevice

**Note: This repository is a duplication of https://github.com/microsoft/FindDevice in order to add minor functionality (fetching of DNS TXT records).**

FindDevice is a basic .NET command line tool you can use to look for devices on your local network or even link-local devices (such as devices that support USBNCM). It uses DNS Service Discovery (DNS-SD) to look for devices that advertise the given service. By default, it looks for devices running [Factory Orchestrator](https://github.com/microsoft/FactoryOrchestrator) (_factorch._tcp.local) but can be configured to look for any DNS-SD service, such as Windows Device Portal (_wdp.tcp.local).

FindDevice makes it easy to discover devices running a specified program/service, so that they can be then interacted with remotely.

## Installation
The [GitHub releases page](https://github.com/lordhubert/HLFindDevice/releases) has the latest builds - win-x64 only for now. Simply download and unzip your desired build and run FindDevice!

You likely will need to edit your firewall rules to allow FindDevice to work properly. It relies on inbound connections on UDP port 5353.
